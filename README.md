#Project Description : Magic Number

The "Magic Number" project, implemented in C#, is a simple guessing game designed to find the correct number between 1 and 10, randomly simulated by the computer. The game provides the player with a finite number of lives to guess the correct number.

The core functionality of the game involves generating a random number within the specified range (1 to 10), prompting the player to guess the number, and providing feedback based on the correctness of the guess. The player is informed about the remaining number of lives throughout the game.
